Such a line will not be read
The main section is set by default
value1=text without quotes
value2=>"value in quotation marks"
value3=>'value in apostrophes' ; and here is the first comment
	 value4	 => 	 1000  		// free space in spaces and tabs
	 value5	 => 	 0.000  	/* different form of commenting
value6 =    // the string will not be read because the parameter value is missing
value7 = '' ; limiting empty characters will also not be taken into account
[part2] 				; a new section!
value1 = this value will be in the new section
value 2 = 200 ; The parameter name is incorrect
value3 =>    good value! # and another way of commenting

[]                           ; Make the main section again!
value7 		=>	      '//path'    # and now the value7 will be read!
value2   =    Yes!        /* We will also redefine the value2
value8   => '"Hey!"'   # you can separate the values in quotation marks or apostrophes

[part3]      //         and another section
value1=>-2     ; so you can
value2=3// but it will not work to leave a comment
value3=>100 //you need space from the value by at least 1 character
